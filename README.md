# Integrating controllerAs and bindToController

## Objectives

- Refactor the scope bindings to use controllerAs and bindToController

## Instructions

In this repo, we've got an app, containing a directive that uses $scope. Refactor this directive to use controllerAs instead, and then change the scope over to bindToController.

** Note: ** Our tests are currently passing - make sure they're still passing after you've made all of your changes!
